== CHANGELOG ==

== AltDrag 1.28 ==

+ Added hardening flags for gcc.

+ Added a RefreshRate in the [Performance] section of AltDrag.ini that 
  allows you to set a minimum time in miliseconds between two Windows
  Redraw when FullWin=1, I recomend a value that corresponds to the
  refresh rate of your monitor ie: 60Hz => RefreshRate=16.

+ Added Maximize action, it can be used to toggle the maximized state,
  combine with Shift to minimize. (Thanks to Jim Teunis for suggestion).

+ Added the CenterFraction in the [General] section of AltDrag.ini to adjust
  The size of the region in percent that is used for the center resizing
  mode. Default is 24% meaning 38% for the sides. You can, for example set it
  to 0 to enable a 4 regions mode instead or the 9 default regions.
  You can also set CenterFraction=100 and combine with the ResizeCenter=0
  option in order to have a pure bottom right mode.

+ Added AeroThreshold option in the [Advanced] options. Default value is 5.
  It corresponds to the threshold distance in pixels at which a window will
  be snapped automatically to the monitor (aero style). If you do not like
  windows snapping for a fraction of second when changing monitors, try to
  set this value to only 2, in such a case it will be necessary to use Ctrl
  to snap windows between monitors. On the other hand if you want you can
  increase this value and this will make snapping between monitors easier
  without Ctrl key...

* Removed dependency to Advapi32.dll from hooks.dll (it was unnecessary).

* Fixed: An Aero-snapped window will now require mouse mouvement before
  moving, instead of a simple Alt+Click.

* Fixed when a window is in full screen you will actually need to move the
  mouse in order to resize it.

* Fixed a remaining Win 10 invisible borders bug that would shrink slightly
  a window when resizing it from a fullscreen state.

* Fixed application hang when changing DPI scaling under Win10. Note that
  for the moment the solution is to restart AltDrag when receaving the
  WM_DPICHANGED message, I hope to have better solution in the future.

* Fixed bug in Transparency action where the windows transparency could no
  longer be modified in some cases.

* Misc cleanup and code refactoring here and there + Fixed all warnings.
  using gcc -Wall parameter.

* Minor GUI improvement for WinNT4 and Win2000.


== AltDrag 1.27 ==

+ Added Elevate option to the tray menu as suggested by Loxaan Oxyde.

+ Added Pause Process option, use Alt+Shift+Pause to pause the process
  of the windows under your cursor, press Alt+Pause to Resume.
  The Option AgressivePause must be set to 1 in [Input] config.
  Use the associated Pause blacklist. This function needs XP or later.
  Note 1: This is a very aggressive option use with caution.
  Note 2: The windows of the paused process will no longer be drawn leading
  to screen tearing on the windows itself.
  Note 3: If you use WIN as a hotkey, then you can still obtain the
  WIN+PAUSE System Properties by pointing first the cursor to the taskbar.

+ Now when using Aero Snap, and resizing towards the top, the windows will
  be maximized vertically when the cursor will touch the top of the screen.
  Same behaviour for the left. This behaviour is ONLY for the top and left
  when using respectively the pure top and pure left resize modes.

* Actually fixed DPI scaling under Win10 with the .manifest I made a typo
  in the first place and never fixed it, because I was not using DPI scaling
  and I thought I was...

* Fixed the toggle borderless action under Windows 10, the window would
  not be properly refreshed because of buggy DWM.

* Fixed: Now the Transparency action will not ignore blacklists.

* Improved translation handling, now all translations are ini files in the
  "Lang" subdirectory of AltDrag. This will simplify addition of new
  Locals, this also allow anyone with notepad to fix his own language.
  Finally you can remove languages that you donot need and if you want only
  english you can remove the whole "Lang" directory.

* Updated zh_CN chinese with Zepp Lu's corrections

* More French and Italian corrections.

== AltDrag 1.25 ==

* Fixed Memory leaks.

== AltDrag 1.24 ==

* Fixed Crash in the config dialog.

* Fixed some windows such as mplayer's windows can now be resized again.

* Fixed translations and French and Italian translations in particular.
  More will come on this.

* Fixed Incorrect snapping of windows in an MDI under Windows 10.

* Fixed: Now on a blacklist, an empty title will be considered as a really
  empty title instead of 'any' title. You should use '*|class' to include
  all windows from a given class instead of just |class. This gives a more
  fine control over blacklist to the user.

* Fixed minor drawing problems when using FullWin=0

== AltDrag 1.23 ==

+ Add option to disable resizing windows that are not resisable
  ie: No WS_THICKFRAME. Default is to resize everything.

* Fixed: Now config dialog can be used on NT4.

* Fixed: Now AeroSnap takes into account the taskbar on NT4.

* Fixed: Now when a windows is not responding, move/resize will be disabled.

* Some optimisations were done.

* Fixed: Windows will be moved/resized in an independant thread avoiding any
  mouse delay/lockup when a window is very unresponsive. This is helpfull for
  Slow video drivers on Win8/10, and for web browsers windows.

== AltDrag 1.22 ==

+ Added options to chose the Aero Snap ratio. You can now chose the position
  in percentage of screen size, where the AeroSnap corners will meet.
  Default is 50%:50% ie:
  AeroHoffset=50 ; Horizontal from left
  AeroVoffset=50 ; Vertical from top
  You could set for example AeroHoffset to 33, this mean that a windows
  snapped to the left will use only 33% of the screen and a window snapped
  to the right will use 67%. The same logic applies to AeroVoffset for the
  vertical direction. This will be appreciated by the widescreen users.

+ Added toggle window title bar and border on/off Action (Igor Bochkariov)
  I used a different implementation though. If you want to just disable the
  titlebar and keep borders, press shift.

* Fixed Transparency action. Now when setting back the windows to an opaque
  state, the WS_EX_LAYERED attribute is removed as it should be. This will
  avoid useless performance issues when using this feature

* Fixed: Now under Windows 10, the DWM api will be used when available to
  obtain correct window rectangle and avoid gaps between snapping windows

* Fixed: now fullscreen windows that have a system menu will not be
  automatically blacklisted.

* Now a full screen window will not be restored unless the mouse is moved
  instead of a simple alt+click as before. It was an annoying behaviour.

* Double click will maximize a normal window and restore a maximized window.

== AltDrag 1.20 ==

+ Ability to drag only a square instead of the full windows (beter perf.)
+ Added an option to replace center resizing mode by bottom-right mode.
+ Added MDIs blacklist: Windows for which MDI behaviour will be disabled.

- No more HookWindows as (unstable and mixing 64 and 32 bit code)
- No more FocusOnTyping (too buggy)

* Fixed cursor performances problems, before the cursor windows used alpha
  blending which is very slow. I just told the windows to do nothing when
  it receave the WM_PAINT or WM_ERASEBKGND messages and that's it, this also
  means proper display for all windows versions instead of being limited to
  Windows 2000+ .

* Now compatible with Windows NT4 sp3+
* Removed dependencies with shlwapi.dll
* Dynamically import PSAPI.DLL in case it is missing (it is not much used)

* Fixed: Cursor windows now captures the mouse input (prevents some bugs).
* Fixed compleatly opaque blacklist reading procedure, it will be trivial to
  add or remove blacklists from now.
* Fixed some drawing problems (not all).

* Fixed .manifest information for high dpi awareness.
* Refactoring by putting some code into functions
* Use GetPrivateProfileInt instead of the 'String version for all int values.
* Avoid floating point arithmetric. Only int math are used.
* Add -nostdlib flag to gcc to avoid useless bloat to the dll and exe.
* Avoid GUI locking when windows is very slow to resize (with FullWin=0 only)

== OS Requirement ==
AltDrag should work on NT4sp3+/2000/XP/2003/Vista/7/8/10.

This program needs at least Windows NT4 service pack 3 or later.
This is because it relies on the 'LowLevel Keyboard/Mouse Proc' functions
that is only supported by the NT based Windows and from NT4 sp3. You will
note that the program also depends on 'SendInput()' that appeared at the
same time. This later dependency is not necessary but is convenient.


== What is AltDrag and why this version? ==
If you ever use any half decent Linux distribution you will realise how bad
the default window manager is under Microsoft Windows OS, in comparison to
what you can get on Linux.

When resizing and moving windows in particular, under Windows you HAVE to
click precisely on the title bar to move or on a thin border to resize.
A much better solution is to combine mouse and keyboard in order for the
ALT key to trigger moving mode, where any left click dragging on the window
will move it and right click will resize depending on where your cursor is
on the window.

Stefan Sundin wrote a little program named AltDrag that adds this behaviour
under Windows. I started using his program which is really awesome but
encountered some performance problems on my old computer. Because AltDrag
Shows the content of the windows while dragging, it is annoying to use
on slow hardware, I also prefer, and find visually less disturbing, to
have just a rectangle when I move/resize the window.
In addition I realized that the program was incompatible with Windows NT4
and Windows 2000 That I still use to this day.

After modifying a little the source the program was quickly compatible
with Windows NT4 and then I started refactoring the code and simplify it
by removing a lot of features and adding a few others this led to
AltDragMicro.

Then I worked again to the fully featured version ane only removed a
couple of buggy features and added mines.
